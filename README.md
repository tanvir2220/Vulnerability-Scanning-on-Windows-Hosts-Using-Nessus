<h1>Vulnerability Scanning on Windows Hosts Using Nessus</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
Project consists of installation and configuration of Nessus Essentials to perform Non-credential and Credential Scanning on Windows Hosts.
<br />

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 (22H2)</b>
- <b>VMWare Workstation Player 16</b>
- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>

<h2>To-Do</h2>

To successfully complete the project, we need to perform following tasks:

1.	Install VMWare Player
2.	Download Windows ISO
3.	Download and Install Nessus Essentials
4.	Setup Virtual Machine
5.	Ensure Connectivity with VM
6.	Create a New Scan in Nessus
7.	Inspecting the First Scan (NO Credentials)
8.	Configuring VM for Credentialed Scans
9.	First Scan with Credentials
10.	Inspecting First Scan with Credentials Results
11.	Installing a Deprecated Firefox on our VM
12.	Inspect Scan Results after Installing Deprecated Firefox
13.	Remediating Some Vulnerabilities
14.	Inspect Scan Results after Remediating Some Vulnerabilities

<h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>

1.	Install VMWare Player: First of all, download and install VMWare Player. I used VMware Workstation 16 for the project. Here's the link for download: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html
2.	Download Windows ISO: Then download Microsoft Windows 10 iso from the official site. Here's the link for download: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
3.	Download and Install Nessus Essentials: Then, download and install Nessus Essentials. Here's the link for download: https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials
4.	Setup Virtual Machine: Setup VMWare after downloading. Masku sure you select NAT for Network Adapter. Then add Windows 10 iso to the VMWare Workstation.
5.	Ensure Connectivity with VM: Turn off Firewall state for the VM's Windows 10 so that we can run scan from our physical host.

<br />
<br />

8.	Configuring VM for Credentialed Scans: We will provide some credentials to Nessus and then we're going to try to rescan the virtual machine with credentials. Enable the remote registry on VMâ€™s Windows host so that our scanner can connect to the registry. Next enable file and printer sharing ON. Then create a local account token filter policy and restart the virtual machine.

11.	Installing a Deprecated Firefox on our VM: Now download and install a deprecated Firefox on the VM. Here's the link: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/

12.	Inspect Scan Results after Installing Deprecated Firefox

<br />

13.	Remediating Some Vulnerabilities: Then we will try to remediate some vulnerabilities by uninsatlling Firefox, and updating Windows install.

14.	Inspect Scan Results after Remediating Some Vulnerabilities
